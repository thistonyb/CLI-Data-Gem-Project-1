# GoodNews
This Ruby Gem provides a CLI to choose a good news topic and then choose from a list of articles in that topic from the Good News website. Once an article is chosen the gem will launch that article in a browser.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'good-news'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install good-news

## Usage

Type the below and follow the on screen prompts.

    $ good-news

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
